# Short-Form Video Feature - Implementation Plan & Status

## Overview & Strategy
- Approach: Backend-assisted ingestion; keep client lightweight while delegating network calls to Supabase Edge Functions.
- Goal: Convert TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels URLs into structured `video` resources with durable job tracking and clear UX feedback.
- Integration strategy: Extend existing storage adapter and UI components; reuse `metadata.shortForm*` fields instead of expanding the `resource_type` enum.
- Processing architecture: Edge Function orchestrates extraction, persists job status, and returns normalized metadata to the client for final resource creation.

## Current Status (Updated 2025-09-29)
- Overall feature: **Phases 0-1, 3-4 COMPLETED** - Core infrastructure, database, and frontend fully implemented and operational.
- Infrastructure ready:

  - âœ… Hybrid storage adapter operational with processing jobs table.
  - âœ… Complete API contracts defined with TypeScript interfaces.
  - âœ… Edge Function infrastructure scaffolded and ready for deployment.
  - âœ… Frontend URL detection system with React hooks implemented.
  - âœ… Processing UI route `/resources/process` built and integrated.
  - âœ… Complete frontend workflow from URL input to resource creation.
- **IMMEDIATE BLOCKER**: Edge Functions not deployed yet (Phase 2 needs completion)
- Next priorities:
  - **Deploy Edge Functions** to enable actual processing functionality.
  - Implement external API integrations (YouTube Data API, TikTok/Instagram oEmbed).
  - Test end-to-end workflow with deployed functions.

## Phase 0: Preparation & Alignment (Status: âœ… COMPLETED)
- âœ… **API Contracts Defined**: Complete TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/shortFormApi.ts` with request/response schemas, error codes, and platform configurations.
- âœ… **Database Schema Deployed**: `processing_jobs` table with RLS policies, indexes, and cleanup functions via migration `20250928000001_add_processing_jobs.sql`.

## Phase 5: Entry Points & Integrations (Status: Planned)
- Dashboard: add "Add Short Video" quick action linking to processing route; show platform badges on resource cards when metadata present.
- Inline URL input: embed detection widget on dashboard with clear validation and navigation to processing page.
- iOS Shortcut integration: document API usage (URL + auth token) and return payload (job status link or resource id).
- Deep link support: ensure `/resources/process?url=` recovers existing job by normalized URL check before spawning a new one.
- Filters & search: enable filtering by `metadata.shortFormPlatform` without altering enums.

## Phase 6: Observability, Hardening, Launch (Status: Planned)
- Instrument Edge Function with structured logs, error metrics, and performance timing; configure alerts via Supabase log drains.
- Implement rate-limit handling with capped retries, retry-after messaging, and user-facing warnings.
- Finalize documentation: user help content, internal runbook, API references, known limitations.
- Run release checklist: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, E2E suite, `npx supabase db lint`, staging smoke tests.
- Prepare production launch: rotate API keys if needed, update Vercel environment variables, monitor initial usage, and capture backlog items (batching, notifications).

## Milestones & Testing Checkpoints
- âœ… **Day 1-2 (2025-09-28)**: Phases 0-1, 3-4 completed - Core infrastructure, API contracts, database schema, URL detection system, and processing UI fully implemented.
- ðŸš¨ **IMMEDIATE (2025-09-29)**: **Phase 2 completion** - Deploy Edge Functions with external API integrations and complete end-to-end workflow.
- ðŸ“… **Next Week**: Phase 5 completion - Dashboard integrations, entry points, and metadata display features.
- ðŸ“… **Following Week**: Phase 6 completion - Observability, testing, hardening, and production launch preparation.
- ðŸ“… **Production Ready**: Full deployment, monitoring, and iterative improvements based on usage feedback.

Testing checkpoints:
- Unit: URL detection helpers, React components, Deno extractors.
- Integration: Edge Function hitting staging APIs, job lifecycle validation, storage adapter writes.
- End-to-end: Manual fallback, automated success, error handling, Supabase vs localStorage modes.

## Key Libraries & Tools
- Frontend: React 18, Vite 7, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, React Router, TanStack Query.
- Backend: Supabase Edge Functions (Deno), Supabase Postgres migrations, Supabase CLI.
- Supporting APIs: YouTube Data API v3, TikTok oEmbed, Instagram oEmbed (subject to compliance).
- Testing: Vitest, Playwright, Deno test runner.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Third-party quotas or privacy blocks: cache results, expose manual fallback, document unsupported scenarios.
- Transcript availability: if captions API access is restricted, omit transcript and flag to users.
- Edge Function execution limits: keep dependencies slim, stream responses carefully, monitor runtime logs.
- Compliance changes: establish monitoring for provider policy updates and plan fallback workflows.

**Critical Path to Working Feature:**
1. **Environment Configuration**: Set up API keys via Supabase CLI:
   - `npx supabase secrets set YOUTUBE_API_KEY=<your_key>`
   - Configure TikTok/Instagram oEmbed tokens if needed
2. **External API Integration**: Implement actual API calls in Edge Function handlers:
   - YouTube Data API v3 for Shorts metadata and transcript extraction
   - TikTok oEmbed API integration with proper error handling
   - Instagram oEmbed API with privacy detection
3. **Edge Function Deployment**: `npx supabase functions deploy short-form`
4. **Frontend Integration**: ProcessVideo component already fully wired to call deployed functions
5. **End-to-End Testing**: Complete workflow validation (frontend â†’ Edge Function â†’ database â†’ resource creation)

**Expected Timeline**: 1-2 days to working end-to-end feature with proper API integrations.

### ðŸ“‹ **TECHNICAL NOTES**
- All SQL migrations remain ASCII-only to satisfy deployment requirements (Unicode issue resolved in migration 20250927162048)
- Storage adapter maintained as single entry point for resource persistence across both Supabase and localStorage modes
- Manual entry path preserved as resilient fallback option throughout processing workflow
- Edge Function infrastructure designed for easy extension to additional platforms in the future

# Short-Form Video Feature - Implementation Plan & Status

## Overview & Strategy
- Approach: Backend-assisted ingestion; keep client lightweight while delegating network calls to Supabase Edge Functions.
- Goal: Convert TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels URLs into structured `video` resources with durable job tracking and clear UX feedback.
- Integration strategy: Extend existing storage adapter and UI components; reuse `metadata.shortForm*` fields instead of expanding the `resource_type` enum.
- Processing architecture: Edge Function orchestrates extraction, persists job status, and returns normalized metadata to the client for final resource creation.

- Day 12-14: Phase 6 completion - Observability, testing, hardening, and production launch preparation.
- Day 15+: Production deployment, monitoring, and iterative improvements based on usage feedback.

Testing checkpoints:
- Unit: URL detection helpers, React components, Deno extractors.
- Integration: Edge Function hitting staging APIs, job lifecycle validation, storage adapter writes.
- End-to-end: Manual fallback, automated success, error handling, Supabase vs localStorage modes.

## Key Libraries & Tools
- Frontend: React 18, Vite 7, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, React Router, TanStack Query.
- Backend: Supabase Edge Functions (Deno), Supabase Postgres migrations, Supabase CLI.
- Supporting APIs: YouTube Data API v3, TikTok oEmbed, Instagram oEmbed (subject to compliance).

# YouTube Shorts Ingestion ‚Äî Implementation Plan & Status

## Overview & Strategy
- **Approach**: Backend-assisted ingestion relying on Supabase Edge Functions to call the YouTube Data API v3 while keeping the client lightweight.
- **Goal**: Convert YouTube Shorts URLs into structured `video` resources with durable job tracking, reliable metadata extraction, and clear UX feedback.
- **Integration**: Extend existing storage adapter and UI components; store all metadata under `metadata.shortForm*` keys to maintain compatibility across the app.

## Current Status (Updated 2025-09-29)
- **Overall**: ‚úÖ Production-ready for YouTube Shorts ingestion.
- **Core Achievements**:
  - ‚úÖ Supabase project migrations deployed (`processing_jobs` table active with indexes and RLS).
  - ‚úÖ Edge Function (`supabase/functions/short-form`) deployed with YouTube integration.
  - ‚úÖ Hybrid storage adapter writes resources using Edge Function payloads.
  - ‚úÖ Frontend flow (`/resources/process`) operational with completed UX.
  - ‚úÖ End-to-end workflow validated using real YouTube Shorts URLs.
- **Next Enhancements**:
  - Dashboard quick actions and badges.
  - Automated tests for URL detection, backend handlers, and UI flow.
  - Observability and alerting for quota/rate limits.

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 0: Preparation & Alignment (‚úÖ Completed)
- API contracts defined in `src/types/shortFormApi.ts` for request/response schemas.
- Supabase migrations deployed: `20250928000001_add_processing_jobs.sql` with triggers, RLS, and indexes.
- Edge Function scaffold established with auth utilities, logging, and URL normalization matching the frontend.
- Supabase CLI workflow validated; environment secrets configured.

### Phase 1: URL Detection & Manual Flow (‚úÖ Completed)
- URL detection utilities in `src/utils/urlDetection.ts` handle multiple YouTube formats.
- React hooks (`useUrlDetection.ts`) provide real-time validation and clipboard integration.
- `/resources/process` route implemented with manual fallback path.
- Resource creation integrated with hybrid storage adapter for Supabase/localStorage modes.
- **Follow-up**: Add Vitest coverage for detection and hook behaviors.

### Phase 2: Edge Function Extractors (‚úÖ Completed ‚Äî Milestone)
- Edge Function routes `/process` and `/status` implemented with JWT validation.
- YouTube Data API v3 integration built with timeout protection, quota handling, and metadata parsing (snippet, content details, tags).
- Secrets management: `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` stored via Supabase secrets.
- Deployment successful via `npx supabase functions deploy short-form`.
- Extensive logging and user-facing error codes for unsupported, quota, or restricted videos.

### Phase 3: Durable Processing Jobs (‚úÖ Completed)
- `processing_jobs` table persists job state, progress, metadata payloads, and warnings.
- Idempotency through `(user_id, normalized_url)` unique constraint.
- Cleanup function configured for completed jobs.
- Edge Function handlers manage lifecycle updates and return polling guidance.

### Phase 4: Processing Experience UI (‚úÖ Completed)
- `/resources/process` UI renders platform badge, progress bar, and status messages.
- TanStack Query handles polling with exponential backoff and server-specified retry intervals.
- Success path automatically constructs `video` resource with YouTube metadata; manual fallback maintains URL and warnings.
- Error surfaces include quota exceeded, private video, region lock, or missing captions.
- **Pending**: Component and Playwright tests for regression coverage.

### Phase 5: Entry Points & Integrations (üöß In Progress)
- Dashboard quick action to launch processing page with pre-selected YouTube detection.
- Display YouTube badges and extraction timestamps on resource cards.
- Document iOS Shortcut flow (URL + auth token) and return payload (job status or resource id).
- Support `/resources/process?url=` deep links to resume YouTube jobs by normalized URL.

### Phase 6: Observability & Launch Hardening (üìù Planned)
- Instrument Edge Function with structured logs and metrics (latency, quota hits, failure codes).
- Implement alerts for quota thresholds; plan for API key rotation.
- Finalize documentation and runbook for support scenarios (quota, private videos).
- Complete test suite: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, E2E workflow, Supabase DB lint.
- Monitor production usage and capture backlog for advanced features (transcripts, batching).

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: URL detection utilities, YouTube ID normalization, React hooks.
- **Integration Tests**: Edge Function hitting staging YouTube API, job lifecycle, storage adapter writes.
- **E2E Tests**: Paste-to-resource workflow, quota error handling, manual fallback.
- **Monitoring**: Log audits for real YouTube metadata extractions.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **API Quotas**: Cache results, monitor usage, and provide user-facing messaging when limits hit; plan additional API keys if needed.
- **Restricted Content**: Detect private/age-restricted videos, offer manual fallback with clear instructions.
- **Edge Function Performance**: Keep dependencies minimal, enforce timeout with `AbortController`, and monitor Supabase logs.
- **Compliance Changes**: Track YouTube policy updates; isolate API logic for easier future adjustments.

## Implementation Summary & Next Steps
- ‚úÖ YouTube Shorts ingestion is fully operational and deployed.
- üîÑ Add automated tests and dashboard integrations.
- üîÑ Enhance observability and finalize launch documentation.
- üìå Continue monitoring API quotas and user feedback to prioritize future refinements (transcript retrieval, batching, notifications).

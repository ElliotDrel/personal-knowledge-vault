## Success Criteria for Each Phase

Each phase should result in something you can actually use and demo. By the end of Phase 3, you'll have a fully functional personal note-taking system. Phases 4-7 add the collaborative and sharing features that make it truly powerful.

The frontend-first approach means you can start using the platform for your own notes immediately, even before adding authentication and sharing features.

# Knowledge Vault - Implementation Plan & Checklist

## Overview & Strategy

**Approach:** Frontend-first development with mock data, then backend integration
**Goal:** Usable platform as quickly as possible with features building incrementally
**Timeline:** Each phase should result in a functional improvement you can actually use
**Current Tech Stack:** Vite + React + TypeScript + shadcn/ui + TanStack Query + React Router

## üìä CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY (Updated September 8, 2025)

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
- **Beautiful UI/UX**: Complete design system with gradients, animations, and responsive layout
- **Navigation**: Full app structure with routing between all main pages
- **Resource Display**: Rich resource cards with filtering, search, and type-based organization
- **Individual Pages**: Detailed resource pages with metadata, notes, and transcript sections
- **Settings UI**: Complete settings interface ready for functionality

### üîÑ Partially Complete:
- **Note Editing**: Basic textarea editor (needs markdown editor integration)
- **Resource Creation**: UI elements exist but no creation flow implemented
- **Settings**: Beautiful UI but field customization not functional

### ‚ùå Missing Critical Features:
- **Data Persistence**: All data is static mock data - no saving mechanism
- **Resource Creation**: Cannot create new resources
- **Authentication**: No login system
- **Sharing**: Share buttons exist but not functional
- **Markdown Editor**: Basic textarea only, no proper markdown editing

### üéØ Next Priority Steps:
1. **Implement resource creation flow** (Phase 2 completion)
2. **Add markdown editor integration** (Improve Phase 3)
3. **Add localStorage persistence** (Bridge to Phase 6)
4. **Implement settings functionality** (Complete Phase 4)

## Success Criteria for Each Phase

Each phase should result in something you can actually use and demo. By the end of Phase 3, you'll have a fully functional personal note-taking system. Phases 4-7 add the collaborative and sharing features that make it truly powerful.

The frontend-first approach means you can start using the platform for your own notes immediately, even before adding authentication and sharing features.

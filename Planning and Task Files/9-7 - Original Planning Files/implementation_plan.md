# Knowledge Vault - Implementation Plan & Status

## Overview & Strategy
- Approach: Frontend-first delivery; build the complete UI with mocked/local data, then layer in Supabase auth and persistence.
- Goal: Provide a usable personal knowledge vault quickly while enabling incremental upgrades.
- Current stack: Vite 7.1 + React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui + React Router + TanStack Query foundation + @uiw/react-md-editor.
- Data layer (current): Intelligent storage adapter (`src/data/storageAdapter.ts`) that uses Supabase for authenticated users and localStorage fallback for offline/unauthenticated state.

## Current Status (Updated 2025-09-27)
- Completed: Phases 1-6 fully implemented; app supports authentication, database persistence, and complete resource management.
- Working features:
  - **Authentication:** Full Supabase magic-link auth with session management, route protection, and user navigation states (`src/pages/Auth.tsx`, `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`, `src/components/auth/RequireAuth.tsx`).
  - **Database Storage:** Complete Supabase integration with storage adapter pattern, RLS policies, and real-time subscriptions (`src/data/supabaseStorage.ts`, `src/data/storageAdapter.ts`, `supabase/migrations/`).
  - **Resource Management:** Full CRUD operations with user-specific data isolation, configurable resource types, and metadata persistence.
  - **UI/UX:** Responsive layout, navigation, resource catalog with search/filters, markdown editor, and error handling with loading states.
- Outstanding gaps:
  - **Phase 7:** Sharing functionality has UI placeholder but no backend implementation (no sharing tables, emails, or access control).
  - **Phase 8:** Production features partially complete (error handling, toasts) but missing auto-save, testing, and deployment automation.
- Upcoming focus:
  1. Phase 7 - implement complete sharing workflows (database schema, UI functionality, email integration).
  2. Phase 8 - add remaining production features (auto-save, comprehensive testing, deployment pipeline).

## Phase 1: Core Frontend Structure (Status: Completed)
- Vite + React + TypeScript scaffold with Tailwind and shadcn/ui components (`package.json`, `src/main.tsx`, `src/index.css`).
- App shell with persistent navigation and routing via React Router (`src/App.tsx`, `src/components/layout/Layout.tsx`, `src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx`).
- Initial pages for dashboard, resources list, resource detail, settings, and not found routes (`src/pages`).

## Phase 2: Resource Creation Flow (Status: Completed)
- `/resources/new` page with type selector, contextual instructions, and multi-step form (`src/pages/NewResource.tsx`).
- Dynamic form fields honor resource type configuration and prevent accidental submits via Enter key (`handleFormKeyDown`, `renderTypeSpecificFields`).
- Successful submissions create resources with timestamps, tag parsing, and redirect to detail view through `addResource` in `src/data/storage.ts`.

## Phase 3: Resource Management & Notes (Status: Completed)
- Resource listing with search, filter by type, grid/list toggle, and tag previews (`src/pages/Resources.tsx`, `src/components/resources/ResourceCard.tsx`).
- Dashboard summary tiles, recent updates, and quick-add shortcuts referencing resource types (`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`).
- Resource detail page enables inline editing of metadata, markdown notes, and transcripts with persistence to localStorage (`src/pages/ResourceDetail.tsx`).
- `useResources` hook provides reactive updates sourced from localStorage with `useSyncExternalStore` (`src/hooks/use-resources.ts`).

## Phase 4: Dynamic Configuration (Status: Completed)
- Settings page supports customizing fields per resource type with add/remove controls and persisted config (`src/pages/Settings.tsx`).
- Local storage layer exposes CRUD helpers for resources and resource type configuration with cache invalidation (`src/data/storage.ts`).
- New resource form and detail view read dynamic configuration to render relevant fields in real time (`src/pages/NewResource.tsx`, `src/pages/ResourceDetail.tsx`).

## Phase 5: Authentication - Magic-Link Email (Status: Completed âœ…)
*Goal: Single-page, email-only auth using Supabase magic links.*
- [âœ…] `src/pages/Auth.tsx`: email form with validation, status messaging, resend cooldown, and explanation of passwordless flow; register route `/auth`.
- [âœ…] Install and configure Supabase client (`npm i @supabase/supabase-js`).
- [âœ…] `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts`: singleton Supabase client reading `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` with configuration validation.
- [âœ…] Form submit: call `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp({ email, options: { emailRedirectTo: window.location.origin + '/auth' } })` and surface success/error feedback.
- [âœ…] Magic link callback: on `/auth`, detect `code` param, call `supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession`, persist session, redirect to intended route.
- [âœ…] Session context: `AuthProvider` in `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` wrapping app, exposing `session`, `user`, and `signOut()` via `useAuth` hook.
- [âœ…] Navigation updates: show "Login" when signed out, avatar/menu with sign-out when authenticated (`src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx`).
- [âœ…] Route protection: `RequireAuth` wrapper in `src/components/auth/RequireAuth.tsx` guards all protected routes with redirect handling.
- [âœ…] Supabase project setup using CLI with `supabase/config.toml` configuration. Auth redirect URLs and environment variables configured.

## Phase 6: Persistent Backend Storage (Status: Completed âœ…)
*Goal: Replace mock/local data with per-user Supabase tables.*
- [âœ…] Define database schema (resources, resource_type_configs, user linkage) in `supabase/migrations/20250926000001_initial_schema.sql`.
- [âœ…] Build comprehensive data access layer in `src/data/supabaseStorage.ts` with full CRUD operations and error handling.
- [âœ…] Implement storage adapter pattern in `src/data/storageAdapter.ts` that switches between Supabase and localStorage based on auth state.
- [âœ…] Persist custom resource type configuration in Supabase with `resource_type_configs` table and real-time updates.
- [âœ…] All operations filter by authenticated user ID with comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policies enforced.
- [âœ…] Robust loading, empty, and error states implemented across all pages with proper async/await patterns and error boundaries.

## Phase 7: Sharing & Collaboration (Status: UI Placeholder Only)
*Goal: Invite collaborators and manage shared access.*
- [ðŸŸ¡] Share dialog UI: Share button exists in `src/pages/ResourceDetail.tsx` but is non-functional placeholder - needs modal implementation.
- [ ] Backend: tables/services for share tokens, invitations, and permissions; send transactional emails (Resend or Supabase SMTP).
- [ ] Access control: enforce viewer vs editor permissions server-side and in UI; protect shared routes.
- [ ] Shared resource experience: dedicated read-only view for invitees, graceful handling of expired or revoked invites.
- [ ] Email templates: branded invitation and notification content.
- [ ] Database schema: Create `shares`, `invitations`, and related tables in new migration file.

## Phase 8: Polish & Production Readiness (Status: Partially Completed)
*Goal: Deliver a stable, deployable product.*
- [ ] Auto-save for notes/transcripts with debounce, save indicators, and conflict handling.
- [âœ…] Toast notifications: Complete implementation using Sonner + shadcn/ui toast system (`src/App.tsx`, `src/components/ui/toast.tsx`).
- [ðŸŸ¡] Error handling: Basic try/catch patterns and error states implemented, but missing comprehensive error boundaries.
- [ ] Security hardening (input sanitization for markdown/HTML, CSRF mitigation on mutations, rate limiting).
- [ ] Automated testing: component tests for forms, integration tests for auth plus CRUD, end-to-end happy paths.
- [ðŸŸ¡] Loading states: Basic loading spinners and states implemented across pages, but missing skeleton loaders and suspense optimization.
- [ ] Performance improvements (skeleton loaders, suspense states, bundle analysis).
- [ ] Deployment: configure environment variables, Supabase project linking, production build verification, deploy to Vercel with monitoring.

# Knowledge Vault - Implementation Plan & Checklist

## Overview & Strategy

**Approach:** Frontend-first development with mock data, then backend integration
**Goal:** Usable platform as quickly as possible with features building incrementally
**Timeline:** Each phase should result in a functional improvement you can actually use

---

## Phase 1: Core Frontend Structure (Days 1-3)
*Goal: Basic app structure with navigation that you can click through*

### Step 1.1: Project Setup & Basic Layout
- [ ] **Initialize Next.js project** with TypeScript
- [ ] **Install core dependencies:**
  - `react-markdown` or `@uiw/react-md-editor` for markdown editing
  - `tailwindcss` for styling (or CSS framework of choice)
  - `react-router-dom` for navigation (if not using Next.js routing)
- [ ] **Create basic app layout:**
  - Header/navigation component
  - Main content area
  - Footer (optional)
- [ ] **Set up routing structure:**
  - `/` - Dashboard
  - `/resources` - Resource listing
  - `/resource/[id]` - Individual resource page
  - `/settings` - Settings page
  - `/login` - Login page (placeholder)

### Step 1.2: Mock Data Structure
- [ ] **Create TypeScript interfaces:**
  ```typescript
  interface ResourceType {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    fields: string[];
  }
  
  interface Resource {
    id: string;
    type: string;
    metadata: Record<string, string>;
    notes: string;
    transcript?: string;
    createdAt: Date;
    updatedAt: Date;
  }
  ```
- [ ] **Create mock data files:**
  - Sample resource types (books, videos, podcasts, short-form)
  - 5-10 sample resources across different types
  - Mock user data

### Step 1.3: Basic Navigation
- [ ] **Dashboard component** with:
  - "Add New Resource" button (links to creation flow)
  - "View All Resources" button (links to listing)
  - "Settings" button
  - Recent resources list (static for now)
- [ ] **Navigation menu** between all main pages
- [ ] **Test:** Can navigate between all main pages

**✅ Checkpoint:** You have a clickable app with all main pages accessible

## Phase 2: Resource Creation Flow (Days 4-6)
*Goal: Can create new resources with forms and see them in listings*

### Step 2.1: Resource Type Selection
- [ ] **Add New Resource page:**
  - Grid or dropdown of resource types
  - Visual selection of type (books, videos, etc.)
  - Navigation to type-specific form
- [ ] **Dynamic form component:**
  - Takes resource type as input
  - Renders form based on type's fields
  - Uses mock field configurations initially

### Step 2.2: Resource Creation Forms
- [ ] **Form components for each resource type:**
  - Dynamic field rendering based on configuration
  - Form validation (title required)
  - Form submission handling
- [ ] **Local state management:**
  - Store new resources in component state or localStorage
  - Generate unique IDs for new resources
- [ ] **Post-creation redirect:**
  - After form submission, redirect to new resource page
  - Pass resource data through URL params or global state

### Step 2.3: Resource Listing Page
- [ ] **Resource listing component:**
  - Display all created resources
  - Show title, type, and creation date
  - Click to open individual resource
- [ ] **Basic filtering:**

  - Load notes from localStorage on page load

### Step 3.3: Transcript Section
- [ ] **Transcript editing area:**
  - Large textarea for transcript content
  - Only show for video/podcast resource types
  - Save transcript with same mechanism as notes
- [ ] **Test:** Create a video resource, add notes and transcript, verify persistence

### Step 3.4: Metadata Editing
- [ ] **Edit metadata functionality:**
  - "Edit" button that switches metadata to form mode
  - Save/cancel buttons
  - Update resource metadata in local storage

## Success Criteria for Each Phase

Each phase should result in something you can actually use and demo. By the end of Phase 3, you'll have a fully functional personal note-taking system. Phases 4-7 add the collaborative and sharing features that make it truly powerful.

The frontend-first approach means you can start using the platform for your own notes immediately, even before adding authentication and sharing features.

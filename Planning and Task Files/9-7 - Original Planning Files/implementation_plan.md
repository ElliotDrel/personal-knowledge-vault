# Knowledge Vault - Implementation Plan & Checklist

## Overview & Strategy

**Approach:** Frontend-first development with mock data, then backend integration
**Goal:** Usable platform as quickly as possible with features building incrementally
**Timeline:** Each phase should result in a functional improvement you can actually use
**Current Tech Stack:** Vite + React + TypeScript + shadcn/ui + TanStack Query + React Router

## üìä CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY (Updated September 8, 2025 - MAJOR PROGRESS!)

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
- **Beautiful UI/UX**: Complete design system with gradients, animations, and responsive layout
- **Navigation**: Full app structure with routing between all main pages
- **Resource Display**: Rich resource cards with filtering, search, and type-based organization
- **Individual Pages**: Detailed resource pages with metadata, notes, and transcript sections
- **Settings UI**: Complete settings interface ready for functionality
- **‚ú® Resource Creation Flow**: Complete `/resources/new` page with dynamic forms for all resource types
- **‚ú® Data Persistence**: localStorage integration - resources save and persist across sessions
- **‚ú® Note Editing**: Full markdown editor with live preview for notes and content
- **‚ú® Resource Management**: Create, edit, and save resources with proper state management

### üîÑ Partially Complete:

### üéØ Next Priority Steps:
1. **‚úÖ COMPLETED: Implement resource creation flow** (Phase 2 completion)
2. **üîÑ IN PROGRESS: Add markdown editor integration** (Improve Phase 3)
3. **‚úÖ COMPLETED: Add localStorage persistence** (Bridge to Phase 6)
4. **Implement settings functionality** (Complete Phase 4)

## Success Criteria for Each Phase

Each phase should result in something you can actually use and demo. By the end of Phase 3, you'll have a fully functional personal note-taking system. Phases 4-7 add the collaborative and sharing features that make it truly powerful.

The frontend-first approach means you can start using the platform for your own notes immediately, even before adding authentication and sharing features.

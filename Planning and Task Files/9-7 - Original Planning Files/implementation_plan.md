# Knowledge Vault - Implementation Plan & Status

## Overview & Strategy
- Approach: Frontend-first delivery; build the complete UI with mocked/local data, then layer in Supabase auth and persistence.
- Goal: Provide a usable personal knowledge vault quickly while enabling incremental upgrades.
- Current stack: Vite 7.1 + React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui + React Router + TanStack Query foundation + @uiw/react-md-editor.
- Data layer (current): localStorage persistence managed in `src/data/storage.ts`; later phases migrate to Supabase for multi-device access.

## Current Status (Updated 2025-09-26)
- Completed: Phases 1-4 implemented and verified in code; app supports creating, editing, and viewing resources with configurable metadata.
- Working features:
  - Responsive layout and navigation in `src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx` and `src/pages/*`.
  - Resource catalog with search, type filters, view toggles, and recent activity (`src/pages/Resources.tsx`, `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`).
  - Resource detail editing including metadata, notes with markdown editor, and transcripts (`src/pages/ResourceDetail.tsx`, `src/components/ui/markdown-editor.tsx`).
  - Dynamic resource type configuration persisted to localStorage (`src/pages/Settings.tsx`, `src/data/storage.ts`, `src/pages/NewResource.tsx`).
- Outstanding gaps:
  - No authentication, authorization, or multi-user separation.
  - No real database or API; all data stored locally per browser.
  - Sharing UI is present but non-functional; no invitations or access control.
  - Limited error handling, testing, and production hardening.
- Upcoming focus:
  1. Phase 5 - add Supabase-powered magic-link authentication and session management.
  2. Phase 6 - replace local mock data with persistent database storage scoped per user.
  3. Phase 7 - implement sharing workflows (UI + backend).
  4. Phase 8 - polish, automated testing, deployment pipeline.

## Phase 1: Core Frontend Structure (Status: Completed)
- Vite + React + TypeScript scaffold with Tailwind and shadcn/ui components (`package.json`, `src/main.tsx`, `src/index.css`).
- App shell with persistent navigation and routing via React Router (`src/App.tsx`, `src/components/layout/Layout.tsx`, `src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx`).
- Initial pages for dashboard, resources list, resource detail, settings, and not found routes (`src/pages`).

## Phase 2: Resource Creation Flow (Status: Completed)
- `/resources/new` page with type selector, contextual instructions, and multi-step form (`src/pages/NewResource.tsx`).
- Dynamic form fields honor resource type configuration and prevent accidental submits via Enter key (`handleFormKeyDown`, `renderTypeSpecificFields`).
- Successful submissions create resources with timestamps, tag parsing, and redirect to detail view through `addResource` in `src/data/storage.ts`.

## Phase 3: Resource Management & Notes (Status: Completed)
- Resource listing with search, filter by type, grid/list toggle, and tag previews (`src/pages/Resources.tsx`, `src/components/resources/ResourceCard.tsx`).
- Dashboard summary tiles, recent updates, and quick-add shortcuts referencing resource types (`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`).
- Resource detail page enables inline editing of metadata, markdown notes, and transcripts with persistence to localStorage (`src/pages/ResourceDetail.tsx`).
- `useResources` hook provides reactive updates sourced from localStorage with `useSyncExternalStore` (`src/hooks/use-resources.ts`).

## Phase 4: Dynamic Configuration (Status: Completed)
- Settings page supports customizing fields per resource type with add/remove controls and persisted config (`src/pages/Settings.tsx`).
- Local storage layer exposes CRUD helpers for resources and resource type configuration with cache invalidation (`src/data/storage.ts`).
- New resource form and detail view read dynamic configuration to render relevant fields in real time (`src/pages/NewResource.tsx`, `src/pages/ResourceDetail.tsx`).

## Phase 5: Authentication - Magic-Link Email (Status: Not Started)
*Goal: Single-page, email-only auth using Supabase magic links.*
- [ ] `src/pages/Auth.tsx`: email form with validation, status messaging, resend cooldown, and explanation of passwordless flow; register route `/auth`.
- [ ] Install and configure Supabase client (`npm i @supabase/supabase-js`).
- [ ] `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts`: singleton Supabase client reading `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
- [ ] Form submit: call `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp({ email, options: { emailRedirectTo: window.location.origin + '/auth' } })` and surface success/error feedback.
- [ ] Magic link callback: on `/auth`, detect `code` param, call `supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession`, persist session, redirect to intended route.
- [ ] Session context: lightweight `AuthProvider` wrapping app, exposing `session`, `user`, and `signOut()` via hook; use `supabase.auth.getSession()` and `onAuthStateChange`.
- [ ] Navigation updates: show "Login" when signed out, avatar/menu with sign-out when authenticated (`src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx`).
- [ ] Route protection: create `RequireAuth` wrapper to guard create/edit flows while preserving `redirectTo`.
- [ ] Supabase project setup using CLI (`supabase init`, `supabase start`, configure auth redirect URLs, populate `.env`). Verify magic link round-trip locally before moving to hosted project.

## Phase 6: Persistent Backend Storage (Status: Not Started)
*Goal: Replace mock/local data with per-user Supabase tables.*
- [ ] Define database schema (resource_types, resources, notes, user linkage) and capture it in Supabase SQL migrations.
- [ ] Build data access layer (REST, RPC, or Supabase client helpers) and integrate with TanStack Query for fetching/caching.
- [ ] Adapt resource CRUD to call Supabase, including optimistic updates and error handling.
- [ ] Persist custom resource type configuration in Supabase and hydrate settings on load.
- [ ] Ensure all operations filter by authenticated user `id`; enforce row level security policies.
- [ ] Implement robust loading, empty, and error states during network operations.

## Phase 7: Sharing & Collaboration (Status: Not Started)
*Goal: Invite collaborators and manage shared access.*
- [ ] Share dialog UI: modal from resource detail with email entry, permission selector, status feedback; list current shares with revoke controls.
- [ ] Backend: tables/services for share tokens, invitations, and permissions; send transactional emails (Resend or Supabase SMTP).
- [ ] Access control: enforce viewer vs editor permissions server-side and in UI; protect shared routes.
- [ ] Shared resource experience: dedicated read-only view for invitees, graceful handling of expired or revoked invites.
- [ ] Email templates: branded invitation and notification content.

## Phase 8: Polish & Production Readiness (Status: Not Started)
*Goal: Deliver a stable, deployable product.*
- [ ] Auto-save for notes/transcripts with debounce, save indicators, and conflict handling.
- [ ] Comprehensive error boundaries, toast notifications, and logging for failures.
- [ ] Security hardening (input sanitization for markdown/HTML, CSRF mitigation on mutations, rate limiting).
- [ ] Automated testing: component tests for forms, integration tests for auth plus CRUD, end-to-end happy paths.
- [ ] Performance improvements (skeleton loaders, suspense states, bundle analysis).
- [ ] Deployment: configure environment variables, Supabase project linking, production build verification, deploy to Vercel with monitoring.

## Key Libraries & Tools
- Frontend: Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, React Router, TanStack Query, @uiw/react-md-editor, lucide-react.
- Data and auth (planned): Supabase for database plus auth, Resend for emails.
- Tooling: ESLint, TypeScript, Vite build tooling, Vercel as deployment target.

## Additional Notes
- Replace placeholder text glyphs in `resourceTypeConfig` icons with consistent emoji or iconography.
- Consider seeding migrations to match current mock data for a smoother transition to Supabase.
- Continue using localStorage as an offline fallback until Supabase integration is complete.

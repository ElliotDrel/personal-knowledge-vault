# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## üö® MANDATORY: Read This File FIRST

1. **READ THIS FILE FIRST**: Before making ANY assumptions, read this document. It contains lessons learned from past mistakes.

2. **CLARIFY REQUIREMENTS WITH EXAMPLES** (NEW - Prevents Wasted Work): When user describes desired behavior with terms like "Notion-style", "Obsidian-like", "WYSIWYG", etc., IMMEDIATELY ask 3-4 specific scenario questions with visual examples BEFORE choosing libraries or writing code. Ambiguous terms mean different things - clarifying first prevents implementing the wrong solution entirely.

3. **DOCUMENTATION-FIRST**: Always check official documentation for Supabase, Vercel, and complex libraries before coding. Use the **Context7 MCP** tools for library docs. For external libraries: check version/changelog for breaking changes, then test minimal example in isolation BEFORE full integration.

4. **SEARCH-FIRST PATTERN (Prevents 90% of Integration Bugs)**: Before creating ANY utility function, search for existing ones first: `rg "normalize" --type ts` or `rg "function.*Url" --type ts`. Reuse existing functions (especially `normalizeUrl`, `detectPlatform`) to ensure consistency. Update ALL occurrences in both `src/` and `supabase/functions/` simultaneously.

5. **Use Storage Adapter Only**: Always `import { useStorageAdapter } from '@/data/storageAdapter'`. Never import `storage.ts` or `supabaseStorage.ts` directly.

6. **Security at Query Level**: Add `.eq('user_id', user.id)` to Supabase queries BEFORE `.single()`. Never fetch first then check permission (timing attack vulnerability).

7. **No Placeholders**: Before claiming "complete", ensure: real endpoints, passes `npm run lint` + `npm run build`, end-to-end test works.

8. **Cross-Reference Before Complete** (CRITICAL - Prevents Missing Requirements): Before marking ANY task complete, explicitly check ALL relevant patterns in this file. Create checklist: Search-First ‚úì, Cascading Fallbacks ‚úì, Security ‚úì, etc. Missing this step causes bugs that code review finds later.

9. **Clarify Before Destructive Changes**: When user says "disable it", "remove it", or "change it" in context of discussing multiple features, ALWAYS ask which one. Never assume. Communication mistakes are harder to fix than code mistakes.

10. **Incremental Testing**: After EACH significant change, run `npm run build` and test in browser.

11. **Systematic Refactoring** (NEW): When removing state variables, functions, or props: use IDE "Find All References" + search string literals (`rg "isEditingNotes"`), update ALL references, then test immediately to catch "undefined" errors.

12. **CLARIFY DATA MODELS BEFORE SCHEMA** (NEW - Prevents Major Rework): When implementing database tables with relationships (comments/replies, threads, hierarchies), ALWAYS ask specific questions about the data model BEFORE creating migrations:
   - "Should this be separate tables or a self-referential table?"
   - "Should child items be the same type or different type as parent?"
   - "How should threading/nesting work? Foreign keys or linked list?"
   - **Why**: Choosing wrong model requires refactoring migrations, types, storage adapter, AND components. Asking 2 questions upfront saves 2+ hours of rework.

13. **WATCH GENERATED TYPES AFTER MIGRATIONS** (NEW): After running `npx supabase gen types typescript --linked`, ALWAYS read the generated types to verify they match your implementation. If user modified migrations, the generated types will show fields you may have missed (e.g., `thread_root_id`, `body`). Proactively update implementation to match schema.

### Supabase CLI-Only Workflow

**CRITICAL RULE**: This project uses the Supabase CLI **EXCLUSIVELY** against the deployed Supabase project. **NO local Docker setup.**

**Common Commands**:
- `npx supabase db push` - Deploy local migrations/config to remote
- `npx supabase db pull` - Pull remote schema changes locally
- `npx supabase functions deploy <name>` - Deploy Edge Function
- `npx supabase secrets list` - View secrets (digests only)
- `npx supabase secrets set KEY=value` - Set API key

**Rules**:
1. All settings (`auth`, `db`, etc.) managed in `supabase/config.toml`
2. **NEVER** use `supabase start`, `supabase functions serve`, or Docker containers
3. Never commit secrets - use Supabase secrets for API keys like `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`
4. Never use `VITE_` prefix for server-side secrets (exposes to browser)

### Edge Function Development & Testing

**DEPLOY-FIRST WORKFLOW** (Not local-first):
1. Make code changes to Edge Functions
2. **Deploy immediately**: `npx supabase functions deploy <name>`
3. Test via the running app against deployed function
4. View logs in Supabase Dashboard (Functions ‚Üí Logs tab)
5. Iterate: fix ‚Üí deploy ‚Üí test

**Critical Points**:
- **NO CLI logs command**: `npx supabase functions logs` doesn't exist. Use Dashboard only.
- **Library compatibility**: Not all npm packages work in Deno/Edge Runtime. Check documentation before full implementation.

### Database Migration Best Practices

*   **CRITICAL: Use ASCII-only in SQL files**. Unicode characters (e.g., emojis ‚úÖ‚ö†Ô∏è) in migrations WILL cause deployment failures.
*   Use modern PostgreSQL functions: `gen_random_uuid()` instead of `uuid_generate_v4()`.
*   Handle Unicode/emojis carefully in your application code when storing them in JSONB.
*   Never delete old migration files.

### Post-Migration Validation (MANDATORY)

After running `npx supabase db push`, ALWAYS verify migrations succeeded:

1. **Check NOTICE logs** - Migration output shows counts/warnings
2. **If needed run validation queries and verify indexes created** - Use queries from migration comments:
3. **Query sample data** - Confirm data structure matches expectations
4. **Document findings** - State "Verified: X resources migrated, Y indexes created"

**CRITICAL**: NOTICE logs show execution, not correctness. Always query actual data.

### Commands

*   `npm run dev`: Start dev server on port 2222.
*   `npm run build`: Build for production.
*   `npm run lint`: Check code quality.
*   `npm install`: Install dependencies.

## Architecture Quick Reference

**Tech Stack**: React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + Supabase


## Testing Checklist (MANDATORY After Changes)

**Build & Quality**: `npm run build` + `npm run lint` pass, `npm run dev` starts

**End-to-End**: Navigate all routes ‚Üí create resource ‚Üí verify navigation/auth/loading/errors

**Full-Stack**:
- Search shared logic in BOTH `src/` + `supabase/functions/` ‚Üí update ALL occurrences
- Check type conditionals include ALL relevant types (`type === 'video' || type === 'short-video'`)
- Test flow: Backend ‚Üí DB ‚Üí API ‚Üí Frontend ‚Üí UI
- Deploy both: frontend (auto) + backend (`npx supabase functions deploy <name>`)
- Verify logs + DB values on both sides

## Critical Code Patterns

### React Hooks Order & Dependencies
**Hook Execution Order** (CRITICAL - violating causes "Cannot access before initialization"):
1. All `useState` declarations
2. All `useQuery`/`useMutation` calls
3. **Derived state** (computed from above)
4. All `useEffect`/`useCallback`/`useMemo` hooks

Avoid referencing derived state (e.g., flags from queries/mutations) before it is declared. Define derived state first, then reference it in effects.

**Callback Stability** (CRITICAL - violating causes infinite loops):
- **NEVER pass inline callbacks to custom hooks** ‚Üí creates re-render cascade
- Inline functions = new reference every render ‚Üí all dependencies update ‚Üí re-render loop
Prefer returning values from hooks and reacting in components. If a callback is unavoidable, stabilize it with `useCallback`.

### React Query: Pure queryFn & Reliable State
Keep `queryFn` pure - **never** call `setLoading(false)` or `setState()` inside it (breaks retry/refetch). Use `onSuccess`/`onError`/`onSettled` for side effects. For critical state flags, use effects that watch `query.isFetched` instead of relying on callbacks (caching/strict mode can prevent callbacks from firing).

### Data Hierarchy: Cascading Ternary
Display exactly one creator field: `channelName` ‚Üí `handle` ‚Üí `author` ‚Üí `creator` (prevents duplicate names).

### Type Safety: Discriminated Unions
For mutually exclusive params: `| { jobId: string; normalizedUrl?: never } | { normalizedUrl: string; jobId?: never }` (catches invalid combinations at build-time).

### Async State Management
All data operations need `loading`/`error` state: `setLoading(true)` ‚Üí `try/catch/finally` ‚Üí `setLoading(false)` in `finally`.

### Switch Statement Block Scope
Wrap each case in `{ }` to scope `const` declarations: `case 'video': { const metadata = ...; }` (prevents conflicts).

### Data Modeling: Parent-Child & Types

- Use a single, self-referential table for parent/child data when entities are the same (e.g., comments & replies), recursion/nesting is needed, or CRUD is unified.
- Use separate tables only when child differs in structure or permissions.
- Avoid duplicate tables/types for the same structure‚Äîprefer a discriminator field.
- In TypeScript, use discriminated unions for shared fields; avoid copy-paste types named differently for identical data.

## Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"Cannot access before initialization"** | Define derived state BEFORE useEffect that uses it |
| **Infinite re-render loop** | Remove inline callbacks from custom hooks OR wrap in useCallback |
| **State flag never sets (query.onSettled)** | Set state in useEffect with query.isFetched dependency instead |
| **URL comparison fails (duplicate detection)** | Use same `normalizeUrl()` function for both sides of comparison |
| **404 Table Not Found** | Run `npx supabase db push` to deploy migrations |
| **Frontend/Backend Mismatch** | Search-first: `rg "normalizeUrl" --type ts` ‚Üí update ALL files |
| **Hooks Order Error** | Move all `useEffect` to END after useState/useQuery/derived-state |
| **Background Polling Noise** | Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Win) / `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) |
| **React Query Side Effects** | Never set state in `queryFn`; use effects with query.isFetched |

## Lessons Learned

### Comments System Implementation (2025-10-10)
**Key Mistakes**:
1. **Wrong Data Model**: Created separate `comment_replies` table instead of self-referential `comments` table with threading fields
2. **Missing Fields**: Didn't include `body` field for comment text
3. **Ignored Generated Types**: Didn't read generated types after migrations to sync implementation
4. **Overcomplicated Types**: Created separate `CommentReply` type instead of using discriminator field
5. **Boundary Condition Bug**: Left `changeStart <= startOffset` in offset recalculation, so edits at the anchor boundary shifted the highlight instead of expanding it.

**Key Takeaway**: **Data model clarity is MORE critical than algorithm optimization**. Ask about threading model BEFORE creating schema. After porting algorithms, explicitly test boundary cases (‚â§, ‚â•, equal) to avoid regressions like offset shifting.

### Markdown Editor Refactor (2025-10-10)
**Key Mistakes**:
1. **Requirements Misunderstanding**: Implemented Novel (WYSIWYG) when user wanted Obsidian-style toggle
2. **Library API Misuse**: Used empty `extensions={[]}` causing "Schema missing top node type" error
3. **No Incremental Testing**: Made multiple changes before testing
4. **API Changes**: Used deprecated `className` prop in react-markdown v10+
5. **Leftover Code**: Removed state but forgot to remove all references

**Key Takeaway**: **Clarification BEFORE coding prevents wasted work**. One minute asking questions saves hours implementing wrong solution.

### Key Patterns
- **Data Model First**: Clarify threading/relationship model BEFORE creating schema
- **Generated Types = Truth**: Read generated types after migrations, sync implementation
- **Discriminated Unions**: Use single type with discriminator over separate types
- **Self-Referential Tables**: Prefer single table with foreign keys when parent/child are same type
- **Hooks Order**: Define derived state BEFORE useEffect that uses it
- **Callback Stability**: Never pass inline callbacks to custom hooks
- **Search-First**: Update ALL occurrences (frontend + backend) when changing shared logic
- **Security**: Filter at query level BEFORE `.single()`
